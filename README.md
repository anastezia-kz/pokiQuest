# Welcome to Your Poki Quest! 🤗

Congrats! You've unlocked the portal to Poki's Frontend Developer Quest.
This isn’t a trick question or a JavaScript riddle wrapped in a CSS enigma. We're not testing how many obscure React hooks you've memorized or whether you can recite the Flexbox spec backwards (🤣 mad respect if you can).

We just want to see how you approach problems, write code, think creatively, and bring interfaces to life.
Bonus points if you make us smile — or better yet, make our UI smile! 😁

### 🌞 Your Mission:

Dive into this assignment designed to showcase your frontend skills.
At first, it might look a little… broken 😞 But don’t worry! Your task is to fix the issues and make it shine. 🌟

We’ve included a video demo (`demonstration.mp4`) in the root folder — check it out to understand how the UI should look and behave.

### 💻 Pro Tips:

- We made it with Parcel. So `yarn parcel src/index.html` will get you started.
- The code might be a bit messy, but that’s part of the fun, right? 🧌
- Feel free to hack away at the code! We want to see your thought process and how you tackle challenges.
- Use whatever tools you love — your fav editor, browser dev tools, or even a magic 8-ball. We're curious how *you* work.
- You’re welcome to create new components or add libraries if needed. Just be sure to document your thought process and decisions when you submit your code.
- You can always visit Poki.com for some inspiration! Feel free to play around with the site and see how we do things.
- If you get stuck, take a break. Go for a walk. Grab a snack.

Good luck and have fun!
And remember: `console.log()` is always there for emotional support 💖
